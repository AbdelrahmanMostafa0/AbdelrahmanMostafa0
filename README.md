# 👋 Hey, I’m Abdelrahman Mostafa

**Frontend Dev · Full-stack in progress · Builder by obsession**


I’m Abdelrahman — a frontend dev who does more than “make things pretty.”  

I don’t just make things look good — I focus on function, performance, and pushing the boundaries of what I can do every day.

I love the power of coding — how it lets you bring any idea to life from scratch. There’s a creative freedom in it that feels like having superpowers. With just a keyboard and a bit of logic, you can build anything you imagine.


For me, it’s not just about writing code — it’s about understanding how things work and how to make them better.

```ts
const stack = {
  frontend: ["HTML5/CSS3", "javascript", "Typescript", 'React', 'Next.js', 'Redux Toolkit', 'Framer Motion'],
  styling: ['CSS3', 'SASS', 'Tailwind CSS'],
  backend (learning): ['Node.js', 'MongoDB', 'Express'],
  tools: ['Git', 'Figma', 'VSCode'],
};

```

## 🗣️ Let's Talk

I like clean code, clean UI, and blaming the backend when things break.
